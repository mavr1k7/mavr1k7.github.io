I have been fascinated with computers for as long as I can remember. I taught myself C++ at age 11 and learned Java soon after. I switched to Linux and built my first game in high school. I learned to hack solely to mess with my IT Administrator dad. I am currently a senior majoring in Computer Science at Brigham Young University. I love to build. Programs, apps, websites, scripts, servers, computers, legos. You name it, Iâ€™ll build it.

Outside of class I am driven by my passion for learning. I frequently teach myself new programming languages. I have spent many hours learning about current hacking techniques. I have completed a number of personal projects that have helped me gain hands-on knowledge in the field. And I have competed in several hacking and programming competitions with fellow students.

When I am not in front of a computer, I am in the mountains snowboarding or mountain biking.
